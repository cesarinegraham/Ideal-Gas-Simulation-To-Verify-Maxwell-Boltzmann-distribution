# Simulation of an Ideal Gas to Verify Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution

In the field of statistical physics, the behavior of ideal gases is fundamental for understanding the principles governing many physical systems. Ideal gases serve as a cornerstone in the development of statistical mechanics, providing a simple yet powerful model for studying the properties of gases at a microscopic level. By simulating ideal gases and analyzing their behavior, we can gain insights into macroscopic phenomena such as pressure, temperature, and energy distribution. Furthermore, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, which describes the speed distribution of particles in an ideal gas, is a pivotal concept in statistical physics, with broad implications in diverse fields such as astrophysics, chemistry, and engineering. 

The motivation for this project stems from the desire to validate the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and explore its connection to the Stefan-Boltzmann constant through computational methods, enhancing our understanding of these fundamental principles and their applications in various scientific disciplines.
